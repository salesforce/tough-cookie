## GetCookiesOptions.expire property

Perform `expiry-time` checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.

**Signature:**

```typescript
expire?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

- Using `false` returns expired cookies and does not remove them from the store, which is potentially useful for replaying `Set-Cookie` headers.

Defaults to `true` if not provided.
