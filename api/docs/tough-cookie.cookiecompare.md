## cookieCompare() function

A comparison function that can be used with [Array.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort)<!-- -->, which orders a list of cookies into the recommended order given in Step 2 of [RFC6265 - Section 5.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265.html#section-5.4)<!-- -->.

The sort algorithm is, in order of precedence:

- Longest [Cookie.path](./tough-cookie.cookie.path.md)

- Oldest [Cookie.creation](./tough-cookie.cookie.creation.md) (which has a 1-ms precision, same as Date)

- Lowest [Cookie.creationIndex](./tough-cookie.cookie.creationindex.md) (to get beyond the 1-ms precision)

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare function cookieCompare(a: Cookie, b: Cookie): number;
```

## Remarks

\#\#\# RFC6265 - Section 5.4 - Step 2

The user agent SHOULD sort the cookie-list in the following order:

- Cookies with longer paths are listed before cookies with shorter paths.

- Among cookies that have equal-length path fields, cookies with earlier creation-times are listed before cookies with later creation-times.

NOTE: Not all user agents sort the cookie-list in this order, but this order reflects common practice when this document was written, and, historically, there have been servers that (erroneously) depended on this order.

\#\#\# Custom Store Implementors

Since the JavaScript Date is limited to a 1-ms precision, cookies within the same millisecond are entirely possible. This is especially true when using the `now` option to `CookieJar.setCookie(...)`<!-- -->. The [Cookie.creationIndex](./tough-cookie.cookie.creationindex.md) property is a per-process global counter, assigned during construction with `new Cookie()`<!-- -->, which preserves the spirit of the RFC sorting: older cookies go first. This works great for [MemoryCookieStore](./tough-cookie.memorycookiestore.md) since `Set-Cookie` headers are parsed in order, but is not so great for distributed systems.

Sophisticated Stores may wish to set this to some other logical clock so that if cookies `A` and `B` are created in the same millisecond, but cookie `A` is created before cookie `B`<!-- -->, then `A.creationIndex < B.creationIndex`<!-- -->.

## Example


```
const cookies = [
  new Cookie({ key: 'a', value: '' }),
  new Cookie({ key: 'b', value: '' }),
  new Cookie({ key: 'c', value: '', path: '/path' }),
  new Cookie({ key: 'd', value: '', path: '/path' }),
]
cookies.sort(cookieCompare)
// cookie sort order would be ['c', 'd', 'a', 'b']
```
